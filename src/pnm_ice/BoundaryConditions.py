    Notes
    -----
    An outflow pore is not integrated and not divergence free. The value in the affected
    pore is averaged from the connected pores, weighted by the respective fluxes.
    For convective contributions, the fluxes are independent of the outflow pore. In contrast,
    diffusive contributions require this averaged value to work properly.
    It is left to the user to make sure, that this is ALWAYS an outflow boundary, in the case
    of reverse flow the behavior is undefinend.

    fast matrix-matrix and matrix-vector operations.

    r"""
    Manipulates the provided Matrix and/or rhs vector according to the boundary conditions

    Parameters
    ----------
    network: any
        OpenPNM network with geometrical information or instance of MulticomponentTools
    bc: list/dict
        Boundary conditions in the form of a dictionary, where each label is associated with a certain type of BC
        In the case of multiple components, a list of dicts needs to be provided where the position in the list
        determines the component ID that the boundary condition is associated with
    A: matrix
        [Np, Np] Matrix to be manipulated, if 'None' is provided this will skipped
    x: array_like
        [Np, 1] numpy array with initial guess
    b: array_like
        [Np, 1] numpy array with rhs values
    type: str
        specifies the type of manipulation, especially for the prescribed value the enforcement differs between
        direct substitution and Newton-iterations

    Returns
    -------
    Return depends on the provided data, if A and b are not 'None', both are returned. Otherwise either A or b are returned.

    Notes
    -----
    Currently supported boundary conditions are:
        'noflow'     - no manipulation required
        'prescribed' - prescribes a value in the specified pore
        'value'      - alias for 'prescribed'
        'rate'       - adds a rate value to the pore
        'outflow'    - labels pore as outflow and interpolates value from connected pores

    The boundary conditions have to be provided by means of a list where each position in the list is associated with a
    component in the system. Each element in the list has to be a dictionary, where the key refers to the label of pores
    that the boundary condition is associated with. The value of the dictionary is again a dictionary with the type of
    boundary condition and the value.
    For single components, only the dictionary may be given as input parameter
    A code example:

    # The system of DGLs models 3 components and the network has two boundary regions 'inlet' and 'outlet'
    Nc = 3
    bc = [{}] * Nc
    bc[0]['inlet']  = {'prescribed': 1.}     # Component 0 has a prescribed value at the inlet with the value 1
    bc[0]['outlet'] = {'outflow'}            # at the outlet the species is allowed to leave the system (technically a set, any provided value will either way be ignored)  # noqa: E501
    bc[1]['inlet']  = {'rate': 0.1}          # Component 1 has an inflow rate with value 0.1
    bc[1]['outlet'] = {'outflow'}            # Component 1 is also allowed to leave the system
    bc[2]['inlet']  = {'noflow'}             # Component 2 is not allowed to enter of leave the system, technically this is not required to specify but the verbosity helps to address setup errors early on  # noqa: E501
