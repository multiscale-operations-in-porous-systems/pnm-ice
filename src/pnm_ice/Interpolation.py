    r"""
    Constructs a [Nt, Np] matrix representing a directed network based on the upwind
    fluxes

    Parameters
    ----------
        network
            An instance with similar signatures as a MulticomponentTools or OpenPNM network object
            In the case of an OpenPNM network, the argument Nc has to be specified
        fluxes: any
            fluxes which determine the upwind direction, see below for more details
        rates: any
            alias for fluxes
        include: list
            a list of integers to specify for which components the matrix should be constructed,
            for components which are not listed here, the rows will be 0. If 'None' is provided,
            all components will be selected
        exclude: list
            Inverse of include, without effect if include is specified
        Nc: int|None
            number of components in the system
    Returns
    -------
        A [Nt, Np] sized CSR-matrix representing a directed network

    Notes
    -----
        The direction of the fluxes is directly linked with the storage of the connections
        inside the OpenPNM network. For more details, refer to the 'create_incidence_matrix' method
        of the network module.
        The resulting matrix IS NOT SCALED with the fluxes and can also be used for determining
        upwind interpolated values.
        The provided fluxes can either be:
            int/float - single value
            list/numpy.ndarray - with size num_components applies the values to each component separately
            numpy.ndarray - with size Nt applies the fluxes to each component by throat: great for convection
            numpy.ndarray - with size Nt * num_components is the most specific application for complex
                            multicomponent coupling, where fluxes can be opposed to each other within
                            the same throat
