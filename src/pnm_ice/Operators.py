    Notes

        For the sum, the flux in each throat is assumed to be directed
        according to underlying specification of the throats in the network. More specifically,
        the flux is directed according the to the 'throat.conn' array, from the pore in column 0 to the pore
        in column 1, e.g. if the throat.conn array looks like this:
        [
            [0, 1]
            [1, 2]
            [2, 3]
        ]
        Then the fluxes are directed from pore 0 to 1, 1 to 2 and 2 to 3. A potential network could be:
